## [Unreleased]

## 0.24.0

### Added

**Announcements**! You can now set a song to play when you enter a channel by calling `b.announcement <song>` ^^

## 0.23.1

### Improved

+ Streaming has been rework. I should not longer abruptly skip streamed songs :sweat_smile:

## 0.23.0

### Added

+ I will now loud-normalize streamed (non-cached) music as well!

### Changed

* Radio is now a separate mode from the queue. Meaning queueing songs will work while radio mode is enabled.
* Generally cleaned up my codebase, so there should be fewer problems :fingers_crossed:

## 0.22.5

### Added

+ I will no longer require you join me on `b.play` if I'm only playing the music to myself :innocent:

## 0.22.4

### Fixed

* I will now recognize non-playable queries and inform you of them :smile:

## 0.22.3

### Added

+ `skip` is now an alias for `next`

## 0.22.2

### Fixed

* Song caching. I should take even less time playing shorter songs that I played before ^^

## 0.22.1

### Fixed

* I fail to play songs less often.
* .radio command works again!

## 0.22.0

### Added

* Added song-streaming! I will respond faster than ever to song requests!
For cached songs I will still loud-normalize them, so `radio`-play is more pleasant.

## 0.21.2

### Fixed

* I won't fail on repeated play requests of the same song >.<

## 0.21.1

### Fixed

* I am more chill about having improved now :sweat_smile: Won't spam you of non-existent changes!

## 0.21.0

### Added

* This changelog! I will now inform you of all of my improvements ^^.
